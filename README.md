## 🧭 Overview
The **Study Dashboard** is a live analytics environment documenting my 100-day journey in data analytics — from foundation to full integration.  
Version 1.3 represents the transition from *personal tracking* to a **portfolio-ready performance system**, integrating quantitative metrics, productivity grids, and KPI micro-cards to visualize learning discipline and tool utilization.

This mirrors a real analytics pipeline:  
**Excel (Foundations)** → **SQL (Data Retrieval)** → **Python (Transformation)** → **Power BI (Visualization)**  

Each phase feeds into measurable performance insights — a reflection of both technical growth and process design.
