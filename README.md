## 🧭 Overview
The **Study Dashboard** is a live analytics system built to visualize and monitor my data learning progress across 100 days.  
It tracks daily blocks, tasks, completion rates, and phase performance — turning my learning into measurable insights.

This dashboard connects the full learning pipeline:  
📊 **Excel (Foundations)** → 🧩 **SQL (Data Retrieval)** → 🐍 **Python (Transformation)** → ⚙️ **Power BI (Visualization)**

---

## 🔁 Pipeline Flow
| Stage | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| **Data Source** | Daily study log from Google Sheets (`Tasks` tab). |
| **Transformation** | Excel formulas + Power Query cleaning for consistency. |
| **Integration** | SQL joins replicated in Python (pandas) for validation. |
| **Visualization** | KPI dashboards in Power BI reflecting Excel and Python outputs. |

---

## 🧮 Core Metrics
| Metric | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| 🧩 **Total Tasks** | Total logged study activities across 100 days. |
| 📈 **Completion %** | Overall completion rate (auto-updated). |
| ⏱ **Total Hours** | Total study time accumulated. |
| 📅 **Schedule Variance** | Difference between actual vs. target schedule. |
| 🧮 **Phase Progress** | Visual progress by learning phase (Excel → SQL → Python → BI). |
