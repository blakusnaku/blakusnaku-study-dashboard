## 🧭 Overview
The **Study Dashboard** is a live analytics system documenting my 100-day journey in data analytics — from foundational learning to integrated pipelines.  
It tracks progress across daily study blocks, task completion rates, and learning phases, turning growth into quantifiable insights.

This project mirrors a real analytics pipeline:
**Excel (Foundations)** → **SQL (Data Retrieval)** → **Python (Transformation)** → **Power BI (Visualization)**  

Each component feeds into a measurable framework designed to reflect discipline, skill depth, and iterative improvement — a reflection of both data literacy and process design.

---

## ⚙️ Pipeline Flow
| Stage | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| **Data Source** | Daily study tracker (Google Sheets) feeding raw progress logs. |
| **Transformation** | Data cleaning & aggregation through Excel formulas and Power Query. |
| **Integration** | SQL joins and pandas validations for data consistency. |
| **Visualization** | Power BI dashboards combining metrics, charts, and design systems. |

---

## 🧮 Core Metrics
| Metric | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| 🧩 **Total Tasks** | Tracks all logged learning activities across 100 days. |
| 📈 **Completion %** | Measures real-time study completion vs. plan. |
| ⏱ **Total Hours** | Aggregates total focused learning time. |
| 📅 **Schedule Variance** | Highlights whether I’m ahead or behind the plan. |
| 🧮 **Phase Progress** | Shows percentage progress for each phase (Excel → SQL → Python → Power BI). |

---

## 🔁 Underlying Projects
This dashboard consolidates output from the **100 Days of Data** series — covering SQL querying, Python cleaning, and Power BI dashboard builds.
